  abstract = {{How do housing and family shape the savings, spending, and inter-generational transfer behaviour of the elderly? Using the Health and Retirement Study, we document that inter-generational transfers to children are substantially backloaded, that homeowners dis-save much more slowly than renters but often sell their houses when entering a nursing home, and that care by children slows down nursing home entry and is linked to larger bequests, particularly of housing. To rationalise these facts, we develop a dynamic, non-cooperative model of the family with an indivisible housing asset and joint bargaining between elderly parents and their children over the housing and care arrangements of the parents. The model generates realistic savings and care choices and matches the timing of transfers and home liquidations. A key novelty is the housing-as-commitment channel: In the absence of long-run family contracts, housing provides a commitment device for more efficient savings. We find that this channel increases homeownership in old age by one-third and families’ willingness to pay for houses by 5–10\%. This mechanism also facilitates informal care, slows down spending, and leads to larger bequests, implications that we support empirically.}},

  abstract  = {We use a quantitative, overlapping-generations, incomplete markets, life-cycle model to explore the extent to which income differences can explain the racial wealth gap. The model features race, education, and family structure-specific stochastic household income processes estimated using data from the PSID, race and education-specific lifespan risk, an income floor, and intergenerational transfers of wealth and labor market ability. A calibrated version of the model fully accounts for the racial wealth gap observed in the data. In addition, it endogenously generates an empirically plausible degree of wealth inequality, both conditional and unconditional on race, and is broadly consistent with observed patterns of wealth accumulation over the life cycle. Simulations of the model suggest that income differences, on their own, can explain 43.0% of the racial wealth gap in levels, while bequest motives and intergenerational transfers of wealth, in the presence of income differences, account for 28.6% and 25.8% of the gap, respectively. We find that the income floor has a negligible impact on the racial wealth gap in levels, but causes the ratio of median wealth (white/black) to more than double as it disproportionately reduces the incentive that low income, low wealth households, the majority of whom are black, have to save. We also find that differences in lifespan risk have only a small impact on the racial wealth gap levels, but lead to a 13.7% increase in the ratio of median wealth.},

This gives rise to altruistic trans-fers and strategic behavior in the consumption?savings decision. We study the Markov-perfect equilibrium that arises from the limit of equilibria in a sequence of finite games. The equilibrium's transfer patterns are empirically plausible. Fur-thermore, agents overconsume relative to the social optimum. In contrast to two-period models, both the richer and the poorer players overconsume long before transfers actually occur. The poorer agent also faces incentives to engage in ex-cessive risk-taking because losses from a gamble are absorbed by both while gains are enjoyed alone.},

Applied to the housing market, it can match the homeownership rate, the average foreclosure rate, and the lower tail of the distribution of home-equity ratios across homeowners prior to the recent crisis. We stress the role of favorable tax treatment of housing in matching these facts. We then use the model to account for the foreclosure crisis in terms of three shocks: overbuilding, financial frictions and foreclosure delays. The financial friction shock accounts for much of the house price decline while the foreclosure delays account for bulk of the rise in foreclosures. The scale of the foreclosure crisis might have been smaller if mortgage interest payments were not tax deductible. Temporarily higher inflation might have lowered the foreclosure rate as well.},

This paper characterizes risk preferences in an expected utility model with commitments. We show that commitments affect risk preferences in two ways: (1) they amplify risk aversion with respect to moderate-stake shocks, and (2) they create a motive to take large-payoff gambles. The model thus helps resolve two basic puzzles in expected utility theory: the discrepancy between moderate-stake and large-stake risk aversion and lottery playing by insurance buyers. We discuss applications of the model such as the optimal design of social insurance and tax policies, added worker effects in labor supply, and portfolio choice. Using event studies of unemployment shocks, we document evidence consistent with the consumption adjustment patterns implied by the model.},

Nevertheless, although housing capital accounts for one-third of the total capital stock, the rate at which housing capital depreciates has only rarely been directly estimated, in part because prior studies do not control for maintenance. For that same reason, widely publicized measures of house price appreciation overstate the capital gain from homeownership. Using data from the American Housing Survey we examine these issues. Over the 1983 to 2001 period, results indicate that gross of maintenance, housing depreciates at roughly 2.5 percent per year, while net of maintenance, housing depreciates at approximately 2 percent per year. Moreover, although the typical home appreciated at an annual real rate of roughly 0.75 percent, after allowing for depreciation and maintenance, the average homeowner experienced little capital gain.},

This model, which accounts for key features in U.S. data, is used as a laboratory for prudential policy. Recourse mortgages increase the cost of default but also lower equity and increase payments. The effect on default is nonmonotonic. Loan-to-value (LTV) limits increase equity and lower the default rate, with negligible effects on housing demand. Combining recourse mortgages and LTV limits reduces the default rate while boosting housing demand. Together, they also prevent spikes in default after large declines in aggregate house prices.},

The portfolio configuration of the wealthy hand-to-mouth suggests that these households may have a high marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income changes, a prediction for which we find empirical support in PSID data.

  abstract  = {A wide body of empirical evidence finds that approximately 25 percent of fiscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are “wealthy hand-to-mouth”: they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard “one-asset” framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.},

Through a series of counterfactual experiments, we study the housing boom and bust around the Great Recession and obtain three main results. First, we ?nd that the main driver of movements in house prices and rents was a shift in beliefs. Shifts in credit conditions do not move house prices but are important for the dynamics of home ownership, leverage, and foreclosures. The role of housing rental markets and long-term mortgages in alleviating credit constraints is central to these ?ndings. Second, our model suggests that the boom-bust in house prices explains half of the corresponding swings in non-durable expenditures and that the transmission mechanism is a wealth e?ect through household balance sheets. Third, we ?nd that a large-scale debt forgiveness program would have done little to temper the collapse of house prices and expenditures, but would have dramatically reduced foreclosures and induced a small, but persistent, increase in consumption during the recovery.},

Past research has cited the importance of down payment constraints, but often has not included data on parental wealth and direct transfers. Using both the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we first confirm other research that children whose parents have more resources are more likely to buy homes themselves. In addition, we find that financial transfers increase the probability of home buying among adult children, net of parental wealth and other characteristics of parents and children. Results from the HRS suggest that receiving a transfer greater than $5000 for any purpose increases the probability of transitioning to homeownership by 15.1%. Results from the PSID suggest that this effect was magnified after the recession.},

The human capital technology features mul-tiple stages of investment during childhood, a college decision, and on-the-job ac-cumulation. The model can jointly explain a wide range of intergenerational rela-tionships, such as the intergenerational elasticities (IGE) of lifetime earnings, college attainment and wealth, while remaining empirically consistent with cross-sectional inequality. Much of life-cycle inequality is determined early in life, which in turn is explained in large part by parental background. The model implies that this is mainly due to early investments in children made by young parents, so life-cycle constraints these parents face are important for understanding the persistence of economic status across generations. Education subsidies, especially early on, can significantly reduce the intergenerational persistence of economic status.},

Using a panel of U.S. metro areas, I calibrate an equilibrium spatial macro-finance model with overlapping generations of mobile households. The dynamics of regional housing markets is explained by an aggregate credit contraction with heterogeneous local impacts rather than by local shocks. Lower millennial income and wealth amplify its effect. The impact of subsidies to first-time buyers is dampened, because they fail to stimulate regions that suffer from larger busts. Place-based subsidies achieve larger gains.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.}},

  abstract  = {We estimate explicit age-varying distributions of idiosyncratic persistent and transitory earnings shocks over workers' life-cycles using a German administrative data set. Large positive shocks, both transitory and persistent, are characteristic for the first eight years of the working life. After the age of 50, large negative shocks become a major source of earnings risk. Between the ages of 30 and 50, most shocks are small and transitory. Large persistent positive shocks that occur early in the working life help to rationalize large wealth and consumption shares of the top one percent in an incomplete markets model.},

  abstract  = {Consumption commitments-goods like housing for which adjustment is costly-change the relationship between risk and consumption. Commitment provides a motive to reduce consumption when possible future losses are too small to warrant adjustment but not when losses are large enough that adjustment would be worthwhile. This implies conditions under which mean-preserving increases in risk can increase housing consumption. Our empirical evidence exploits the interaction of these conditions with a novel proxy for unemployment risk: couples sharing an occupation. Consistent with our model, same-occupation couples consume more housing only when adjustment costs are high and potential losses are sufficiently large. {\textcopyright} 2010 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

These patterns hold true at each consumption quartile. This paper develops a quantitative, dynamic, general equilibrium model of life-cycle behavior, that generates consumption profiles consistent with the observed data. Borrowing constraints are essential in explaining the accumulation of housing stock early in life, while transaction costs are crucial in generating the slow downsizing of the housing stock later in life.},
